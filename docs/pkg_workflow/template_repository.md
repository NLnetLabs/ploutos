# NLnet Labs Rust Cargo Packaging **template** repository

_**Tip:** If you just want to invoke our reusable packaging workflow from your own repository see the [starter workflow](./starter_workflow.md)._

If you want to create a new repository that builds a Rust application using our [reusable packaging workflow](./README.md), or want to learn how to fully configure your own repository to do so, see our [template repository](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github-testing/blob/main/README.md).
