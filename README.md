This repository provides configuration and services for the NLnet Labs GitHub account and its repositories.

In particular it provides:

| Feature | Documentation |
| --- | --- |
| [Organization profile README](https://github.com/NLnetLabs) | [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#organization-profile-readmes) |
| [Reusable workflows](.github/workflows/) | [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) |

At the time of writing this repository contains the [Ploutos](docs/README.md) reusable workflow for packaging Rust projects, and a starter workflow to make it easier to add Ploutos to existing GitHub projects.
